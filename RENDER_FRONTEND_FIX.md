# ðŸ”§ Fix for Render Frontend Deployment

## **The Problem**
Render was trying to run `react-scripts` from the root directory, but it's only installed in the `frontend/` directory.

## **The Solution**
I've updated the build configuration to properly install frontend dependencies and run the build from the correct directory.

## **Updated Render Configuration**

### **For Static Site Deployment:**

**Build Command:** `npm run build`
**Publish Directory:** `frontend/build`

**Environment Variables:**
- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: `https://collab-track-rjjs.onrender.com/api`

### **Alternative: Direct Frontend Build**

If the above doesn't work, try these settings:

**Build Command:** `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`
**Publish Directory:** `frontend/build`

## **Steps to Fix Your Deployment:**

1. **Go to your Render service dashboard**
2. **Click on your frontend service**
3. **Go to "Settings" tab**
4. **Update the build command to:** `npm run build`
5. **Make sure publish directory is:** `frontend/build`
6. **Click "Save Changes"**
7. **Go to "Deploys" tab**
8. **Click "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Deploy latest commit"**

## **Expected Build Process:**

```
==> Running build command 'npm run build'...
==> cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
==> Installing frontend dependencies...
==> Building React app...
==> Build completed successfully!
```

## **If Still Having Issues:**

Try this alternative build command:
```
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build
```

The `npm ci` command is more reliable for CI/CD environments.

## **Final Result:**

Once the build succeeds, your frontend will be available at:
`https://collabtrack-frontend.onrender.com`

And it will connect to your backend at:
`https://collab-track-rjjs.onrender.com/api`

## **Test Your App:**

Visit your frontend URL and try logging in with:
- **Admin**: `admin@collabtrack.com` / `password123`
- **Project Manager**: `pm@collabtrack.com` / `password123`
- **Team Member**: `member@collabtrack.com` / `password123`

Your CollabTrack application should be fully functional! ðŸŽ‰
